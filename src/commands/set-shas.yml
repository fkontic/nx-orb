  Derives SHAs for base and head for use in `nx affected` commands in CI

parameters:
  main-branch-name:
    type: string
    default: "main"
    description: |
      The name of the main branch in your repo, used as the target of PRs. E.g. main, master etc.
  error-on-no-successful-workflow:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      By default, if no successful workflow is found on the main branch to determine the SHA,
      we will log a warning and use HEAD~1. Enable this option to error and exit instead.
  workflow-name:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      By default, the script is looking for the last successful job across all workflows.
      Set this param to search for the last successful job within a specific workflow.
  allow-on-hold-workflow:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      By default, only workflows with CircleCI status of "success" will be detected for the main branch.
      Enable this option to also detect workflows with CircleCI status of "on_hold" in case your workflow requires manual approvals.
  ignore-main-branch-name:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      If set to true, searches for a successful workflow on any branch or tag.
